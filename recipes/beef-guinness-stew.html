        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for this grazy. It's a very simple dish, but at the same time it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. Great served over a bed of green onion-mashed potatoes.</p>

                <li>Cook and stir bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until bacon is browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off heat and transfer bacon into a large stew pot, reserving bacon fat in the skillet.</li>

                <li>Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute; pour beer into skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food into the liquid. Pour cooking liquid from skillet into the stew pot. Stir in tomato paste, thyme sprigs, carrots, celery, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and enough chicken broth to cover.</li>
